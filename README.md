# Route Optimization with Continuous Data Collection of an Uncertain Road System:

The purpose of this project is to create a package delivery algorithm that can continuously prioritize tasks, schedule tasks, and collect data about a graph with uncertain edge weights. The delivery of large single trip packages to retail or average consumers involves significant planning to schedule deliveries and maximize profit. However, this is not an easy task for a delivery company that is new to an area and has no knowledge of the road system. The team solves this problem by first creating a road map of an area assigning random traversal times between each point and guaranteeing the road system is connected. Second, the team creates a route finding algorithm that balances discovery with exploitation of available data to learn and choose more optimal delivery routes. Third, the team builds a scheduler that continuously updates the delivery plan based on priority to maximize profit. Finally, the team compares the results of their algorithm to a monte carlo route planner to determine the algorithmâ€™s effectiveness.

## Uncertainty Algorthims Implemented: 

1. Pure Randomness
   - Our Monte Carlo utilizes particle swarm optimization and pure randomness to run a 100 simulations to predict the best route to the delivery, after the simulations are ran the best path is utilized as the actual delivery route
  
2. Explore and Exploit 
   - Our USGS utilizes an Epsilon Greedy algorithm to allow the delievery to have a random chance of taking a suboptimal path to further explore the enviroment
  
3. Sorting and Ordering 
   - Our USGS utilizes a prioritization algorithm prioritizes the payrate for package delivery and will select the packages with the highest payrate
  
4. Scheduling 
   - Our USGS utilizes a predictive priority algorithm to schedule the package delivery sequence by comparing price over distance

## Uncertainty Algorthims attempted: 
We were unable to fully implement the Ant Colony algorithm with our node edge interface given the time constraint, however we did get these algorithms working but are unable to visualize them: 

1. Bayes Rule
   - Our Ant Colony utilizes a modified Baysian rule to update the pheremone values and asssign a probability of each path at a given node

2. Scheduling 
   - Our Ant Colony algorithm utilizes a predictive priority algorithm to schedule the paxckage delivery sequence by comparing price over distance
