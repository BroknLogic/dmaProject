# Route Optimization with Continuous Data Collection of an Uncertain Road System:

The purpose of this project is to create a package delivery algorithm that can continuously prioritize tasks, schedule tasks, and collect data about a graph with uncertain edge weights. The delivery of large single trip packages to retail or average consumers involves significant planning to schedule deliveries and maximize profit. However, this is not an easy task for a delivery company that is new to an area and has no knowledge of the road system. The team solves this problem by first creating a road map of an area assigning random traversal times between each point and guaranteeing the road system is connected. Second, the team creates a route finding algorithm that balances discovery with exploitation of available data to learn and choose more optimal delivery routes. Third, the team builds a scheduler that continuously updates the delivery plan based on priority to maximize profit. Finally, the team compares the results of their algorithm to a monte carlo route planner to determine the algorithmâ€™s effectiveness.

## Uncertainty Algorthims Implemented: 

1. Pure Randomness
   - Our Monte Carlo method utilizes particle swarm optimization to determine an optimal delivery schedule for a single day. This is done by using a naive path planner in the form of a breadth first search. The algorithm then randomly delivers packages until the time limit is reached. 100 of these schedules are then created and the delivery schedule with the best profit is used to deliver packages. 
  
2. Explore and Exploit 
   - Our USGS utilizes an Epsilon Greedy algorithm to inject randomness into the actual path the delivery drive takes and subsequently updates its information with. This is done by using a Djikstra's for determining the single source shortest path (SSSP) to all nodes in the graph. The algorithm then reconstructs the path to the source with a random chance of picking any road that it hasn't already traversed. This then forces the driver to explore the road system after each delivery and update its information about road traversal times for the scheduler.
  
3. Sorting and Ordering 
   - Our USGS utilizes a prioritization algorithm prioritizes uses the information it knows about the road map to calculate a pay rate for each delivery. It does this by using the stored road traversal time to calculate a perspective time to deliver a package and the using that scale the pay for delivering the package.
  
4. Scheduling 
   - Our USGS utilizes a predictive priority algorithm (pay rate) to pick an optimal delivery schedule. This is done by calculating the priority (pay rate) after each delivery. Because the information about the road system is updated after each delivery, this guarantees the scheduler is picking deliveries that will yield the most profit before picking the next delivery to make.

## Uncertainty Algorthims attempted: 
We were unable to fully implement the Ant Colony algorithm with our node edge interface given the time constraint, however we did get these algorithms working but are unable to visualize them: 

1. Bayes Rule
   - Ant Colony Optimization utilizes a modified Baysian rule to determine the probability of traversing a the edges connected to a node. This is done by using the pheremones on each edge connected to a given node to calculate a posterior for each edge. These posteriors are then used to dictate the probability of the ant using that edge in its path.

2. Scheduling 
   - Our Ant Colony algorithm utilizes a predictive priority algorithm to create a delivery route which optimizes the profit given a list of packages. This is done making the amount of pheremone left each edge a function of the profit for delivering to that node and the time to traverse the edge. This effectively creates the delivery route based on the best profit.
